Script for Recreating Migrated Shared Mailboxes to Online Only

You must use the mailbox alias attribute when adding which mailboxes that need to be recreated.
This script doesn't add back "send on behalf" so look it up before!
Example: Get-exoMailbox -RecipientTypeDetails sharedmailbox -Properties GrantSendOnBehalfTo | select alias,GrantSendOnBehalfTo

Make sure these values are on all the shared mailboxes that you want to recreate!
This happens if first migrated as user and then converted to shared mailbox
msExchRecipientDisplayType	-2147483642
msExchRecipientTypeDetails	34359738368
msExchRemoteRecipientType	100
To update all mailboxes in a specific OU:
get-aduser -Filter {msExchRemoteRecipientType -eq 4} -SearchBase "OU=Shared Mailboxes,OU=Exchange Resources,OU=Company,DC=Company,DC=com" | `
set-aduser -Replace @{'msExchRemoteRecipientType'=100;'msExchRecipientDisplayType'=-2147483642;msExchRecipientTypeDetails=34359738368}
